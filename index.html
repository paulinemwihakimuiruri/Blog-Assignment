        <h2>Gender Roles and Relationship Expectations.</h2>
        <p>
        From the quote above, in relation to the traditions of our societies, it was expected of a husband to be in control of his wife. In many communities,<br>
        the husband would dictate the way of living of his family. The wife would be tasked with staying at home, doing house chores and taking care of the<br>
        childen and abide by the rules set by her husband. This was what Abel's family expected of Patricia when they went to visit his family together with <br>
        his son Andrew. This kind of tradition was archaic and Patricia decided she would never go to visit his family again.
        </p>

        <p>
        In modern society, the gender roles are now evolving, moving away from these traditions and leaning towards more diverse and inclusive approaches. In<br>
        politics and work places as well, so many women have risen to the occassion, taking on authority and responsibilities. They are allowed to handle family<br>
        as well as have careers. Men in modern society encourage their wives to pursue their dreams and they show up to support them when needed. Both male and<br>
        female are being exposed to same opportunities without gender discrimination. The notion of being a female is being discarded and now everyone with the<br>
        ability to take on a task is considered equal regardless of gender.

        <h2>Personal Insights</h2>
        <p>Trends in human society have led to gender stereotypes discarding traditional ways of living. They have led to people hearnessing their full potential<br>
        and contributing to the growth of the society. After apartheid, women were able to take on jobs and the book talks about Patricia rising to greater heights<br>
        at her job and being able to support her chidren and pay her bills.</p>
