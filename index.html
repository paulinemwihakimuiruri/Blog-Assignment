    <h2>Gender Roles and Relationship Expectations.</h2>
    <p>
    From the quote above, in relation to the traditions of <br>
    our societies, it was expected of a husband to be in <br>
    control of his wife. In many communitiesthe husband would<br>
    dictate the way of living of his family. The wife, would<br>
    be tasked with staying at home, doing house chores and <br>
    taking care of the childen and abide by the rules set by<br>
    her husband. This was what Abel's family expected of Patricia<br>
    when they went to visit his family together with his son Andrew.<br>
    This kind of tradition was archaic and Patricia decided she <br>
    would never go to visit his family again.
    </p>

    <p>
    In modern society, the gender roles are now evolving, moving<br>
    away from these traditions and leaning towards more diverse<br>
    and inclusive approaches.In politics and work places as well,<br>
    so many women have risen to the occassion, taking on authority<br>
    and responsibilities. They are allowed to handle family as well <br>
    as have careers. Men in modern society encourage their wives to <br>
    pursue their dreams and they show up to support them when needed. <br>
    Both men and women are being exposed to same opportunities  without<br>
     gender discrimination. The notion of being a female is being <br>
     discarded and now everyone with the ability to take on a task is <br>
     considered equal regardless of gender.

    <h2>Personal Insights</h2>
    <p>Trends in our current societies have led to gender stereotypes <br>
        discarding traditional ways of living. They have led to people<br>
        hearnessing their full potential and contributing to the growth <br>
        of the society. After apartheid, women were able to take on jobs <br>
        and the book talks about Patricia rising to greater heights at her<br>
        job and being able to support her chidren and pay her bills.</p>
